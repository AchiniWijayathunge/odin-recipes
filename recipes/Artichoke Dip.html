    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This spinach artichoke dip is delicious. It's so cheesy and fragrant. If you don't like artichokes, don't worry — you'll never know they're in there! 
    </p>
    <p>
        My only question is: Is it okay to eat it with a spoon right out of the dish?
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup frozen chopped spinach, thawed and drained</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
